# moso-vue
My personal portfolio (re)built with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) and [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org).

### Install
Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install the dependencies.

### Scripts
Since this project is compiled with Nuxt, you have the following scripts at hand:

```shell
$ npm run dev        # `nuxt` will launch a development server on `localhost:3000` with hot-reloading
$ npm run build      # `nuxt build` will build your app with webpack, and minify JS & CSS (production)
$ npm run start      # `nuxt start` will start the server in production mode (after running `nuxt build`)
$ npm run generate   # `nuxt generate` will build the app and generate every route as HTML files
$ npm run lint:      # ESLint will lint all JS- and Vue-files while ignoring files in `.gitignore`
$ npm run precommit: # Same as `npm run lint`, however recommended best practice
```

The usual workflow is to run `npm run dev` while developing. Then run `npm run build` and `npm run generate` to build the app, where the scripts will generate a `~/dist`-folder. In this folder are all the files you'd upload to your host.

You can also run `npm run build` and `npm run start` on a dedicated server to run a node.js server. You will have to set up proxying to `localhost:3000` and point the webroot to `/dist/` for this to work. Some prefer this solution, and it will autogenerate the files if they're changed - ie. an ecommerce solution where the product stock changes all the time.

### Folder structure
__Almost__ as per Nuxt standard, the folder structure is as follows:

- `~/assets`
- `~/components`
- `~/layouts`
- `~/plugins`
- `~/static`
- `~/views`*

All common styling belongs in the `~/assets/sass`-folder, and the files are named so it should be easy to find what's what.

All the custom Vue-components resides in the `~/components`-folder.

All layouts resides in the `~/layouts`-folder (yeah, really).

All custom plugin loaders and, in this case, directives and classes resides in the `~/plugins`-folder.

All static content like images and fonts are stored in the `~/static`-folder, as per Nuxt standard.

\* = The only difference from a standard Nuxt installation is, that I'm using a custom router config. Since the standard Nuxt generation of routes doesn't allow me to name routes manually, I had to solve it this way. That means that all pages that in a standard Nuxt install resides in `~/pages`, are now stored in `~/views`, and manually set up in `/router.js`. The Nuxt config is only set to generate the `/`-route, as this is needed for the index page to work.

### Routing
As mentioned, all routes have to be set up manually. However, it's rather straight forward, and it follows [vue-router](https://router.vuejs.org/en/essentials/named-routes.html)'s scheme. All routes are residing in `/router.js`. Here's an example:

```javascript
import Vue from 'vue'
import Router from 'vue-router'

import PageA from '~/views/page-a.vue'
import PageB from '~/views/page-b.vue'
import PageC from '~/views/page-c.vue'
import PageError from '~/views/page-error.vue'

Vue.use(Router)

export function createRouter() {
    return new Router({
        linkActiveClass: 'router-link-active',
        routes: [
            {
                path: '/page-a',
                component: PageA,
                name: 'Page A'
            },
            {
                path: '/page-b',
                component: PageB,
                name: 'Page B'
            },
            {
                path: '/page-c',
                component: PageC,
                name: 'Page C'
            },
            {
                path: '/404',
                component: PageError,
                name: '404 - not found'
            },
            {
                path: '*',
                redirect: '404'
            }
        ]
    })
}
```

This will generate the routes for `/page-a`, `/page-b`, `/page-c`, `/404`, and will redirect all non-routes (example: `/ghhghghg`) to `/404`.

# Editing content
You probably want to edit the content, if you want to copy the site and just change some stuff.

In this Nuxt install, I've gone back to having content directly in the views. This is because I haven't been able to get Axios running properly. I have also edited the Profile-view a bit.

However it's on my todo-list to get Axios up and running, plus to throw an error, if the api-request isn't coming from my own server, so you'll notice once you boot up the page.

# Custom components
This project is full of custom and homemade components. Unused components are, of course, not being loaded, to keep `app.js` at a minimum.

Perhaps I will write some documentation on how they're used, if this is needed. However, since this is just to show my Vue-skills, and since this is a personal website just for me, I haven't written any. **They should be straight forward, though**.

The list is as follows:

### moso-components

##### moso-drawer-list
This is basically the sidenav menu content.

##### moso-profile
This is the small box with the social icons and profile image you see on the front/profile page.

##### moso-profile-item
These items are the social icons in said small box.

##### moso-progressbar
These are the "switch" progressbars you see in the Skills-section on the profile page. These are not draggable, sorry. A demo can be found on [my CodePen](https://codepen.io/moso/pen/evQxRE).

##### moso-project
This is the projects you see on the projects page. This is also where I use [vue-masonry](https://github.com/shershen08/vue-masonry).

##### moso-sidenav
This is the sidenav. Yeah... This also includes the sidenav-backdrop - the dark, clickable area that covers the page when the sidebar is active on small devices.

##### moso-timeline
This is the timeline you see on the Resume page. A working demo can be found on [my CodePen](https://codepen.io/moso/pen/MpPRgg) with slightly different styling.

##### moso-timeline-item
Wrapper for the items inside `moso-timeline`.

##### moso-toolbar
This is basically just the toolbar for the title and the version badge.

##### version-badge
A simple version badge that is literally just a string with some styling.

##### nano-ripple
This is from the framework [Nano](https://github.com/getnano/nano-framework) that I'm working on in my sparetime. This is the small ripple you see when you click on buttons and the social icons. This is inspired by [Material Design](https://getmdl.io/components/index.html#buttons-section) (look under "button with ripple") and requires a custom directive and a custom class which are both included in this project.
